                This soft, classic t-shirt was masterfully designed for a
                perfect fit. The evergreen stitch gives this piece a rustic
                quality while the chest pocket and frill bottom add a much
                needed touch of modern style. The reversible t-shirt not only
                looks great, but is thrown into the bargain.
